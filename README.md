# _check_cert_

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/vespian/check-cert.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vespian/check-cert)

_check_cert is a certificate expiration check capable of scanning GIT repos
and sending data on expiring/expired certificates back to the monitoring system._

## Project Setup

In order to run check_cert you need to have following dependencies installed:
- Dulwich - python implementation of GIT (https://www.samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/docs/)
- *ssh* command in your PATH
- argparse library
- pyOpenSSL (https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/)
- pymisc (https://github.com/vespian/pymisc)
- python 2.6 or 2.7
- dulwich library

You can also use debian packaging rules from debian/ directory to build a deb
package.

Unfortunatelly, dulwich library is broken on wheezy:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/dulwich/+bug/1326213

so the script depends on the newest version (0.9.7) even though 0.8.5 is
sufficient when it comes to functionality.

## Usage

### Configuration

Actions taken by the script are determined by its command line and the
configuration file. The command line has a build-in help system:

```
usage: check_cert [-h] [--version] -c CONFIG_FILE [-v] [-s] [-d]

Simple certificate expiration check

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        Location of the configuration file
  -v, --verbose         Provide extra logging messages.
  -s, --std-err         Log to stderr instead of syslog
  -d, --dont-send       Do not send data to Riemann [use for debugging]

The configuration file is a plain YAML document. It's syntax is as follows:

```

  bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb: "cert b"
```

### Operation

The script connects to the $repo_user@$repo_host:$repo_port via SSH and clones
repository $repo_url to a *bare* repository in "$repo_tmpdir/repository". If
the repository already exists, it is only updated with newest referances. Only
$repo_masterbranch branch is pulled in along with all the objects it points to,
topic branches are not downloaded.

The connection is established using the $repo_pubkey pubkey, and the $repo_user
itself should have very limited privileges.

Next, the repository is scanned in search of files ending with one of the
check_cert:CERTIFICATE_EXTENSIONS extensions. Currently all possible
certificate extensions are listed but only ['pem', 'crt', 'cer'] are currently
supported (see check_cert:get_cert_expiration method). For the remaing ones
only a warning is issued.

For each certificate found a sha1sum is computed, and if the result is found in
$ignored_certs hash, then the certificate is ignored even if it expires/exp-
ired.

If the number of days till the certificate expires is less than $critical_tresh
(by default 15) - a "critical" partial status is generated, if it less than
$warn_tresh but more than $critical_tresh - a "warning" partial status is gene-
rated. Unsuported certificate yields an 'unknown' state and expired ones of
course the 'critical'.

All the 'partial status' updates are agregated by the 'pymisc' library and
each message can only elevate up the final status of the metric send to
monitoring system. Currently, the hierarchy is as follows:

       (lowest)ok->warn->critical->unknown(highest)

script errors, exceptions and unexcpected conditions result in imidiate elevation
to 'unknown' status and sending the metric to monitoring system ASAP if only
possible.

Interfacing with monitoring system is done by pymisc. Following options are
passed directly to the library. Please see pymisc's documentation for
information on their meaning:
* $riemann_enabled
* $riemann_ttl
* $riemann_hosts
* $riemann_tags
* $nrpe_enabled

### Maintenance

In order to not to let the "$repo_tmpdir/repository" repository grow endlessly
a 'git gc' command should be executed once a day by i.e. a cronjob. It will
repack all the packs and remove dangling objects.

## Contributing

All patches are welcome ! Please use Github issue tracking and/or create a pull
request.

### Testing

Currenlty the unittest python library is used to perform all the testing. In
test/ directory you can find:
- modules/ - modules used by unittests
- moduletests/ - the unittests themselves
- fabric/ - sample input files and test certificates temporary directories
- output_coverage_html/ - coverage tests results in a form of an html webpage

Unittests can be started either by using *nosetest* command:

```
check_cert/ (master✗) # nosetests
[20:33:02]
......
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 6 tests in 0.449s

OK
```

or by issuing the *run_tests.py* command:

```
check_cert/ (master✗) # run_tests.py
[20:33:04]
Created test certificate expired_3_days.pem
Created test certificate expire_6_days.pem
Created test certificate expire_21_days.pem
Created test certificate expire_41_days.pem
Created test certificate expire_41_days.der
......
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 6 tests in 0.362s

OK
```

The difference is that the *run_tests.py* takes care of generating coverage
reports for you.

All the dependencies required for performing the unittests are decribed in debian
packaging scripts and are as follows:
- unittests2
- coverage
- python-mock
- openssl command in the PATH
, plus all the dependencies mentioned in 'Project Setup' section.
